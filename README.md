## For Developers

The plugin development environment uses the [WordPress Scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/) package and relies on NPM and Composer. The `package.json` and `composer.json` manage necessary dependencies for testing and building. The scripts in `package.json` interface with the WP Scripts package to do most of the heavy lifting.

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the plugin to a directory on your computer.
2. Change into that directory.
3. Install the NPM and Composer dependencies.
4. Ensure linting and coding standards checks are working -- this should exit with zero (0) errors.
5. Create a new branch for local development.

In a terminal:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/washingtonstateuniversity/hrswp-employee-recognition.git
cd hrswp-employee-recognition
npm install
composer install
npm test -s
git checkout -b new-branch-name
~~~

### Build Commands

The following commands will handle basic build functions. (Remove the `-s` flag to show additional debug info.)

- `npm run build`: Transforms source code so itâ€™s consolidated and optimized for production.
- `npm run lint`: Check all PHP, JS, and CSS files for coding style compliance.
- `npm run export`: Creates a zip file of the plugin for installation.

See the scripts section of `package.json` for additional available commands.
